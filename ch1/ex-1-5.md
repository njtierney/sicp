Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicativeorder evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He deﬁnes the following two procedures:

```
(define (p) (p)) (define (test x y)

(if (= x 0) 0 y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

```
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. (Assume that the evaluation

27 rule for the special form if is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or applicative order: e predicate expression is evaluated ﬁrst, and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative expression.)
