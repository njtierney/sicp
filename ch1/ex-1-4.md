Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

```
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

if  `b` is positive, then add `b` to `a`.
if `b` is negative, then subtract `b` from `a`.
